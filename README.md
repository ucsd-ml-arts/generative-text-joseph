# Project 1 Generative Text

Joseph Chang, jdchang@ucsd.edu

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to generate oldie song lyrics inspired by Bobby Darin. These can be used for future song ideas or matched with other music. In particular, we want to test the results of using modern words as our starting phrase to see how the generator reacts. To have Bobby Darin singing about iPhones or new technology he never saw would be interesting. It would make his voice present today even though he is no longer alive. The model used for this project is a LSTM RNN. RNNs are optimal for language prediction as it understands every word based on the previous word's understanding. It has persistence. In our case, the model architecture and training parameters are adjusted to optimize the model to generate the most sensible and accurate lyrics while retaining a sense of randomness so the model is not overfitted. A webscraper is used to create the Bobby Darin lyrics dataset which is a compilation of 300 songs.


## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- training
Contains all training checkpoints
- Project_1.ipynb
Contains code for processing dataset, training model, generating lyrics, saving to .txt file
- WebScraper.pynb
Contains code for scraping a specific artist's lyrics from Genius and outputting it in a .txt file
- bobby-darin-lyrics.txt
Contains lyrics to 300 of Bobby Darin's songs
- bobby-darin-lyrics-generated.txt
Contains lyrics generated by trained model

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- WebScraper.pynb - Genius lyrics web scraping code
- Project_1.pynb - Training and generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

Temperature most optimal at 1.0. Above 1.0 starts producing words that aren't real. Below has little noticable difference, but it is definitely closer to the original lyrics' order which we want to avoid for this project.

Output Results

iphones gonna be mine
this evenin'
'bout a quarter to nine

get it!
ahhh, ah
oh!

oh, the stars
are gonna twinkle and shine

are gonna tenderly twine
this evenin' around you
quarter to nine

i know i won't be late
'cause at half past eight
i'll be waitin' there
i'll be waitin'-f-past eight
i will hurry there
i'm gonna be waitin' where the lane begins
waitin'
